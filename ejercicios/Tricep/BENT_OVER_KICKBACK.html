        <img src="./img/Bent-Over-Triceps-Kickback.gif" alt="" />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Starting Position:</strong> Begin by holding 2 dumbbells in
            your hands. Keep a slight bend in your knees, and then hinge forward
            from your waist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pull back your upper arm so that it is next to (parallel) your body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Form:</strong> While keeping your upper arm next to your
            body, exhale and straighten your elbow. Hold for a brief second and
            then slowly lower to the starting position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tips:</strong> In the standing position this exercise will
            help to strengthen the postural and lower back muscles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be mindful of the position of your lower back. Donâ€™t let your lower
            back round too far forwards. Use your lower back muscles to keep
            your spine and pelvis in a neutral position
          </li>
          <li>
            If your hamstring muscles are tight, it may make it difficult to get
            into the correct position. Only bend as far as you can while keeping
            your back in good alignment. Stretch your hamstrings and bend your
            knees a little more to relieve some stiffness in the back of your
            legs.
          </li>
          <li>
            In regards to the upper body, do your best to keep your upper arm at
            your side throughout the entire exercise.
          </li>

        <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
        <p>
          Among the exercises that work the upper arm muscles, kickback and its
          variations are very effective. You can easily apply these exercises
          with dumbbells, cables or resistance bands.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The bent over kickback is an isolation exercise which builds
            strength and muscle in all three heads which make up the tricep
            muscle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kickback exercise works best with light to moderate weights and
            medium to high reps. Use the kickbacks as a finishing workout and
            really feel the pump.
          </li>
