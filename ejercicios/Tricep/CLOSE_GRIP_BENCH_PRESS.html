        The close grip bench press is a variation of the traditional bench press
        exercise where the lifter holds the bar with a narrow grip, usually with
        the hands placed closer than shoulder-width apart. This exercise
        primarily targets the triceps, but also engages the chest and shoulders.

        <img src="./img/Barbell-Triceps-Extension.gif" alt="" />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Lie down on a flat bench with your feet flat on the ground and your
            back in a neutral position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grab the bar with a close grip, with your hands placed slightly less
            than shoulder-width apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unrack the bar and lower it slowly towards your chest while keeping
            your elbows tucked in close to your body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pause briefly at the bottom of the movement, then press the bar back
            up to the starting position, squeezing your triceps at the top.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat for your desired number of repetitions.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It’s important to maintain proper form throughout the exercise,
          especially keeping your elbows close to your body to emphasize the
          triceps engagement and reduce strain on the shoulders. Additionally,
          be sure to use an appropriate weight for your fitness level, and
          always warm up before beginning any weightlifting exercise.

        <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Increased triceps strength: The close grip bench press places a
            greater emphasis on the triceps than the traditional bench press,
            making it an effective exercise for building triceps strength and
            size. It is generally used as an auxiliary exercise to increase
            Lock-Off Strength in powerlifting programs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved bench press performance: Strengthening the triceps through
            close grip bench pressing can improve overall bench press
            performance by increasing the lifter’s ability to lock out heavy
            weights.
          </li>
          <li>
            Targeting different muscle fibers: The narrow grip used in the close
            grip bench press targets the inner portion of the chest muscles, as
            well as the front deltoids, allowing for more comprehensive muscle
            development.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduced stress on the shoulders: The close grip bench press places
            less strain on the shoulder joint compared to the wider grip bench
            press, making it a safer exercise option for individuals with
            shoulder issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            Increased functional strength: The close grip bench press can
            improve functional strength, which is the strength necessary for
            performing everyday activities and movements, such as pushing and
            pulling.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In general, close-grip bench press is an upper body compound exercise
          that targets the triceps muscles and is useful for build up your upper
          and inner chest. One of the main differences between the standard
          bench press and the close-grip bench press is that it focuses on the
          inner chest and triceps, rather than working your entire chest.
