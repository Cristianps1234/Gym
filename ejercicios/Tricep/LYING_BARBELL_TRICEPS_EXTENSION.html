        <img src="./img/Barbell-Triceps-Extension.gif" alt="" />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start by lying flat on a bench with your feet planted firmly on the
            ground. Your head should be at the end of the bench, and your eyes
            should be directly under the barbell.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grasp the barbell with an underhand grip (palms facing up) slightly
            wider than shoulder-width apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Position the barbell above your chest with your arms fully extended,
            perpendicular to the ground. This is the starting position.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly lower the barbell down
            towards your forehead or just above it. Lower the barbell by bending
            your elbows; they should point toward the ceiling.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower the barbell under control, feeling the stretch in your triceps
            as you do so. Your forearms should end up nearly parallel to the
            ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold the stretched position for a brief moment, focusing on engaging
            your triceps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Push the barbell back up to the starting position by extending your
            elbows and fully contracting your triceps.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat the movement for the desired number of repetitions.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keep your upper arms still throughout the exercise; only your
            forearms should move.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid using momentum or swinging your arms during the movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower the barbell under control to avoid placing excessive strain on
            your elbows or shoulders.
          </li>
          <li>Use a spotter if needed, especially when using heavy weights.</li>
          <li>
            Breathe naturally, exhaling as you push the barbell up and inhaling
            as you lower it down.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Start with a weight that allows you to complete the desired number of
          repetitions with good technique. Gradually increase the resistance as
          you progress in strength and proficiency.

        <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
        <p>
          Triceps Isolation: The main benefit of the lying barbell triceps
          extension is the hypertrophy of the triceps that comes with the
          motion. Lying barbell triceps extension are isolation exercises,
          meaning they use just one joint. Unlike other triceps exercises, the
          lying triceps extension activates all three heads of the triceps,
          which means that your entire triceps will become stronger through this
          exercise. Full Range of Motion: The lying position allows for a full
          range of motion in the triceps, ensuring they are worked through their
          entire length. However, lying barbell extensions put no pressure on
          the wrists so they are an alternative for people with wrist strain or
          injury. Muscle Definition: Regularly incorporating the lying barbell
          triceps extension into your workout routine can help enhance the
          definition of your triceps, providing a more sculpted appearance to
          your upper arms. Upper Body Strength: Strengthening the triceps
          through this exercise can also contribute to improved overall upper
          body strength and performance in pushing movements.
