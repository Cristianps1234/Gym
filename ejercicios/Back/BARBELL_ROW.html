        <p>
          The Barbell Bent Over Row is a compound weightlifting exercise that
          primarily targets the muscles of the upper back, including the lats
          (latissimus dorsi), rhomboids, and traps, as well as the biceps and
          rear deltoids. It also engages the core muscles for stability. This
          exercise is commonly used to build strength and muscle mass in the
          back and arms.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Setup:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart,
            toes pointing forward, and the barbell in front of you on the floor.
            You can choose to use an overhand grip (palms facing you) or an
            underhand grip (palms facing away) on the bar, depending on your
            preference and comfort.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bend at the Hips:</strong> Hinge at your hips while keeping
            your back straight. Lower your torso until it is almost parallel to
            the floor. Keep your knees slightly bent throughout the movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grasp the Barbell:</strong> Reach down and grip the barbell
            with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your arms
            should be fully extended, and your grip should be firm.
          </li>
          <img src="./img/bent-over-form.gif" alt="" />
          <li>
            <strong>Starting Position:</strong> Your back should be flat, chest
            out, and shoulder blades pulled back and down. This is the starting
            position.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Row:</strong> Pull the barbell towards your upper
            abdomen or lower chest while keeping your elbows close to your body.
            Focus on squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the
            movement to engage your back muscles fully. Keep your core tight
            throughout the exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lower the Barbell:</strong> Slowly lower the barbell back
            down to the starting position while maintaining control. Do not
            allow the weight to pull you forward; instead, control the descent.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>TIPS FOR PROPER FORM:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Avoid rounding your back during the exercise, as this can lead to
            injury. Keep your back straight and engage your core for stability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep your head in a neutral position, looking slightly forward, to
            maintain proper spinal alignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not use momentum to lift the weight; focus on using your back and
            arm muscles to perform the rowing movement.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can use a weightlifting belt for extra support if needed,
            especially when lifting heavy loads.

        <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Back Muscle Development:</strong> The barbell bent-over row is
          a compound exercise used to develop and strengthen the entire
          posterior chain, including both the hips and upper back. While most
          exercises target a specific muscle on the back of the body, this
          compound exercise targets the entire back every rep. It helps to build
          a strong, well-developed back, giving you a more defined and muscular
          appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Enhances Upper Body Strength:</strong> This exercise, which is
          very popular in bodybuilding and power lifting, is very effective for
          the development of improved muscle strength, endurance and overall
          body strength. You can add it to your training programs as part of
          muscle growth and upper body strength training.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Boosts Grip Strength:</strong> Holding onto the barbell during
          the exercise challenges your grip strength. Over time, this can lead
          to improved grip strength, which can be beneficial for various
          exercises and activities in and out of the gym.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Improves Posture:</strong> The best way to protect your back
          against injury is to strengthen the muscles that support it. The
          erector spinae muscles, also known as spinal erectors, run vertically
          down your entire back on either side of your spine. These are not
          muscles you can typically see bulging underneath your skin, as they
          are below other muscles, yet they still make up a large portion of the
          posterior chain.
