        <ol>
          <li>
            Stand facing a set of parallel bars with your hands shoulder-width
            apart and palms facing inward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jump up and straighten your arms so that your body is fully
            extended. Your feet should be off the ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower your body by bending your elbows and leaning forward slightly,
            keeping your elbows close to your sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue lowering until your shoulders are slightly below your
            elbows or until you feel a stretch in your chest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Push yourself back up to the starting position by straightening your
            arms, exhaling as you do so.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat for your desired number of repetitions.</li>

        <h1>CHEST DIPS BENEFITS</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dips are a closed-chain exercise. As a bodyweight movement that
            targets your chest and triceps, dips have numerous benefits in terms
            of strength improvements, mass building, and general fitness
            performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dips are literally one of the best exercises you can do for your
            upper body. Keep in mind that the position of your torso affects the
            focus of the exercise. A slight forward tilt is better for targeting
            the pectorals, and the more you bend forward the harder you work the
            pectorals. An upright posture shifts the focus to the triceps.
