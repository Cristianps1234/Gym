        The Close-Grip Incline Dumbbell Press, also known as the Incline Crush
        Press or Incline Squeeze Press, is a variation of the incline bench
        press. It involves using dumbbells with a close grip, typically with
        your palms facing each other. This exercise can be done with either a
        single dumbbell or two dumbbells.

        <ol>
          <li>
            Set Up: Adjust an inclined bench to your preferred angle, typically
            between 30-45 degrees. Sit on the bench with your back firmly
            against it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grip: Hold a single dumbbell with both hands, positioning it close
            to your chest. Your palms should face each other, and your hands
            should be shoulder-width apart.
          </li>
          <li>
            Positioning: Plant your feet flat on the ground for stability.
            Slightly arch your lower back while maintaining contact with the
            bench. Keep your head, shoulders, and glutes in contact with the
            bench throughout the exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press: Push the dumbbell upward until your arm is fully extended,
            but do not lock out your elbow. Exhale during the pressing phase.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lower: Lower the dumbbell with control to your upper chest while
            inhaling. Keep your elbows at a 90-degree angle or slightly less.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat for your desired number of repetitions.</li>

        <h2>TIPS FOR SUCCESS:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Begin with a light to moderate weight to ensure proper form and
            balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus on a controlled and deliberate movement throughout the
            exercise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid jerky or rapid motions; maintain tension on your chest
            muscles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorporate this exercise into your upper body or chest workout
            routine once or twice a week.
          </li>

        <h1>BENEFITS</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Upper Chest Development: This exercise places greater emphasis on
            the upper chest, helping to create a well-balanced and aesthetically
            pleasing chest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhanced Muscle Activation: The close-grip position engages the
            upper chest fibers effectively, leading to greater muscle activation
            and growth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved Strength: As a compound movement, this exercise not only
            builds muscle but also contributes to increased upper body strength.
